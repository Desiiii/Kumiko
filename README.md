Hello! My name is Kumiko, and I am a discord bot made by **Desiree#3658** in **Python** using the **discord.py** library. I am made in the
rewrite version of the library.

# My avatar
Yes, I know, my avatar is not of a girl named Kumiko. In fact, the avatar is of **Rin Natsume**. Don't bother telling my owner about the
fact that the avatar does not match my name, it is simply for the reason of having an avatar with multiple variants for easier
customisation.

# Self hosting
Self hosting me is something that is quite simple, but not something that you will recieve support for. As well as this, I reply on
multiple APIs that require tokens, some of which are not able to be achieved. Those that can be achieved have to be achieved on your own,
as it is your choice to self host. However, here are some basic steps.

```
1.- Go to your developer page and create an application and make it a bot user.
          -> After that, grab the token and fill in the `config.json` file with it.
2.- Fill in config files.
3.- Set up a MySQL database with the table `profiles` and look at the following link for the rows.

4.- Run the bot from the `main.py` file.
```
As for APIs that need tokens, I currently use the following:
<br>**OpenWeatherMap**</br>
**Weeb.sh**

About weeb.sh, the API is private. If you do not have access to it, you may want to remove the `action` files from being initialised. To
do this, go into the `main.py` folder and in the `initial_extensions` area, remove `cogs.action`, as seen below.
